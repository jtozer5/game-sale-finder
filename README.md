# game-sale-finder

* This is a script I created for a python class in 2019. It was working at one point, but I'm having an issue with the steamapi now.  The code is still pretty clear and works.

* This script is designed to take your Steam user name, check the genres of the most recently played games and cross reference those genres with games currently on sale.

* There are a couple of options for delivery built in.  Commented sections have the code for running a scheduler in a separate thread so that the script can email the results to a user every week.
